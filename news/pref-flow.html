	The first (and currently only) visualisation on this website is the preference flow diagram.
	You can view them on <a href='#/electorates'>any electorate page.</a>

<p>
	This diagram takes calculations from the AEC and shows how preferences flow from one candidate to another.
	This can reveal to us interesting information to us that simple two part tallies cannot, such as:
	the type of votes each party consists of,
	how preferred the winning candidate is,
	likely trends in an electorates future voting.
</p>

<p>
	There are many trends throughout the preference flow data. I'll list a few of the trends I found...
</p>

<p>
	The most common trend is having two major parties with one or more minor parties which distribute votes to the major parties each round.
	This can be seen mostly simply in <a href='#/electorates/Barton'>Barton</a> and in a more complex way in <a href='#/electorate/McEwen'>McEwen</a>
</p>

<p>
	A very interesting trend is the "come from behind victory",
	in which a candidate who was previously not winning on preferences suddenly takes the seat at the last preference round.
	This trend suggests that between half and two thirds of voters don't support the "leading" party and support two different relatively major parties.
	The prime example of this is the electorate of <a href="#/electorates/Denison">Denision</a>.
	The independent member Andrew Wilke is losing the preferences to the Labor Party until he recieives a majority of Liberal Party preferences.
</p>

<p>
	The final trend I'll point out is the "flipped preferences".
	This trends occurs in close seats and is almost a come from behind victory in the second to last round.
	However, on the last round the preference swap back!
	This occcurs when there are two minor parties allied with the two major parties. Generally the large major being group with the large minor and vice-versa.
	Since the small minor party is knocked out first its preferences pull the small major party ahead only to be trounced by the large major party when the large minor party's preferences are distributed.
	You can see this happening in the seats of <a href="#/electorates/Brand">Brand</a> and <a href="#/electorate/Fremantle">Fremantle</a> (this diagram may look a little odd on smaller screens).
