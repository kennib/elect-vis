<p>There's lots of data surrounding this election and past elections.
But what does it all mean?</p>
<p>Visualisations can be an extremely helpful tool for exploring and understanding data.
They can help us find the diamond information in the data rough.</p>
<p>This website is my own way of exploring the data surrounding Australia's Federal Elections.
However, with any luck I can help others discover more about their own country, electorates or
(heaven forbid) inform some opinions.</p>
<p>There's not much content here to start off with. Just preferences diagrams for each electorate in 2010.
However, I hope to add more years of data, more features like browsing electorates by map or viewing by polling station
and different types of visualisations such as electorate swing over time.</p>
